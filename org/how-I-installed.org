I followed the advice under "Ubuntu" (*not* Debian) here:
https://packages.ps.informatik.uni-kiel.de/curry/index.html

Specifically, I ran the wget command there to add the key, and then I added the line for the stable (*not* nightly) builds to the end of my /etc/apt/sources.list file. For <codename> in that line I substituted bionic, because Ubuntu 18.04 = Bionic Beaver. Last I ran apt update and apt install pakcs.
