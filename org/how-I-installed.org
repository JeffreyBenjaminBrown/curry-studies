* TODO These are chronological
* getting pakcs
I followed the advice under "Ubuntu" (*not* Debian) here:
https://packages.ps.informatik.uni-kiel.de/curry/index.html

Specifically, I ran the wget command there to add the key, and then I added the line for the stable (*not* nightly) builds to the end of my /etc/apt/sources.list file. For <codename> in that line I substituted bionic, because Ubuntu 18.04 = Bionic Beaver. Last I ran apt update and apt install pakcs.
* getting currycheck
In the mailing list thread "Specifying default rules: Why and how?", the first answer from Michael Hanus was to run this:

cypm update && cypm install currycheck
* getting currypp
Same trick:
cypm update && cypm install currypp
* apt remove pakcs
* install from pakcs-2.0.2-amd64-Linux.tar.gz
uncompress, make, then add bin/ to PATHx
